* [Round 2](#round2)
* [Round 3](#round3)


<b name="round1">Round 1(GeeksforGeeks)</b><br/>
- The first round was a hackathon(coding contest) conducted on Hackerearth platform. There were three coding questions, two questions were based on arrays and the third question is based on graphs. The overall difficulty of the exam is medium. I could solve the first two questions completely.
- I got a call after 15 days that I have cleared the online round and an interview
was scheduled. (Geeksforgeeks)

<b name="round2">Round 2(GeeksforGeeks)</b><br/>
- The interviewer asked about myself. As most of my projects are on data science, she asked some basic questions of data science and probability. 

- Questions:
+   What is univariate and bivariate data
+   What is long and wide data
+   There are two girls, given one of them is a girl what is the probability that both of them are girls
+   What is normal distribution?
+   Can mean and variance can be the same? When will they be different?
 

<b name="round3">Round 3(GeeksforGeeks)</b><br/>
In this round, the interviewer asked about basic data structures and algorithms followed by a puzzle.

-    Questions:
+    What is multithreading?
+    What is the difference between hashmap and hashtable
+    What is hash function and how to choose it?
+    How does a text editor work under the hood(in terms of data structures)?
+    famous horse puzzle though I don’t know the solution before, I tried to come close to answer and he is satisfied.


<b name="round4">Round 4(GeeksforGeeks)</b><br/>
   + Given an array, find the longest consecutive sequence. You can find it  here.
   + Follow up is that, if there is zero in the array, it can be treated as any number. Then how to find the longest consecutive sequence.
   + How does a dynamic array created and what is it’s time complexity? 


<b name="question"> Question Bank </b> <br/>
1. Given a list of Students and Subjects along with credits of each, a student can select only those subjects whose credits are less than equal to his/her credits.
   Return the number of pairs of students and subjects.
   e.g:
   Subjects:{3,4,1,2}
   students:{5,3}
   
   So there can be 7 pairs as The Student having 5 credits can select all the subjects and the student having credits 3 can select subjects with credits 1,2,3.
   Easy Binary search and sort question.

2. Find LCA of a binary tree.
 Online Test. 50 MCQs including Java, C, C++, SQL, Aptitude, Logic Based, Verbal. 2 coding questions were also there. Multiple Sets. Approx. 30 were shorlisted.

Two Problems for me were implementation based Arrays, String coding questions. One easy, One medium with 30 mins in hand.
Round 2 :
3. Why Amex? Why analyst profile when you have such a technical profile ?
4. Any Previous PPOs ? Any data science related experience etc. ? Previous projects were asked in data science.
Then he asked me few Sql queries related to self-join and find Manager and employee in a given table.
Few basic C/c++ questions like What is dangling pointer, Post increment operator,
Static functions.
Then a programming question on Sieve.


Round 3 :
5. why do you want to work with us and what are your future perspective?
6. Where do you see 5 years ahead?
7. Which team would I prefer if given a chance.
